The dataset consist of three files reviews.csv, listing.csv and calendar.csv:-
1. First we analyzed reviews by breaking the comments fields
2. Then we analyzed the reviews file by diggiing the reviews column
3. Finally we scaled the price section and dropped the zero values and made a pecentage of the most used price value

## Installation
No such necessary libraries are required to run the code in notebook but have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python.
The code run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivation
The dataset contains information from 2016 to 2017.
In this project, I did some analysis on guests and hosts data used in travelling from different regions:
1. We break the comment column to gain analysis on comments given by guests and find percentage on mostly typed comment
2. Then we analyze reviews rated by guests out of 10 through visualization graph and discussed payment policy
3. Last and final technique I analyzed step by step was to search for the most price paid in the data was **$150** from 13 milion data. The price hikes at $150 in company's whole revenue of two years that helps company to focus on what it has to work on for future better productive growth
